Constraints related to keras based Optical Character Recognition Engine:-
1. There may be two different products of the same product code, we can't distinguish it based on the color or texture using keras based ocr.
2. We also can't distinguish based on the dimensions of the box.
3. We cannot distinguish based on the font size too even if it was same.
